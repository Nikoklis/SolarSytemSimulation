# SolarSytemSimulation
This is a basic solarsystem simulation written in C++ opengl . 

This is a project for the course Computer Graphics 1 in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications , Athens(Greece).
It consists of 2 main files and 1 header for the function/struct declarations . The main.cpp file has code for initializing the program
with openGL functions and also a matrix initialization for the stars of the solar system.

After all the initialization we continue with the main project , in which we have a file that gives us the Objects (planets to be
rendered in the program) and also we create small little stars and one big star ( the sun ) .

There is also a function to control the camera and the animation in the project called "Keyboard" , and some other extra utilies like zoom on a planet or zoom in/out of where the camera is positioned.
